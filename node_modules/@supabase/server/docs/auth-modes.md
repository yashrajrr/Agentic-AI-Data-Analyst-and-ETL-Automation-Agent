# Auth Modes

## Overview

Every request is validated against one or more auth modes before your handler runs. The `auth` config determines which modes are accepted.

> **`allow` is deprecated.** The `auth` option replaces the legacy `allow` option. `allow` still works (with a one-time `console.warn`) but will be removed in a future major release. Migration is a find-and-replace: `allow:` → `auth:`.

> **Breaking — auth API renamed.** `'always'` is now `'none'` and `'public'` is now `'publishable'` (including the colon variants `'public:<name>'` → `'publishable:<name>'`). The field on `AuthResult` and `SupabaseContext` was also renamed from `authType` to `authMode` so it matches the `AuthMode` type. The old names no longer work — update the option values you pass in **and** any runtime checks on `ctx.authType` (now `ctx.authMode`).

| Mode            | Credential required                                | Typical use case                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `'user'`        | Valid JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>`       | Authenticated user endpoints           |
| `'publishable'` | Valid `default` publishable key in `apikey` header | Client-facing, key-validated endpoints |
| `'secret'`      | Valid `default` secret key in `apikey` header      | Server-to-server, internal calls       |
| `'none'`        | None                                               | Open endpoints, custom auth wrappers   |

> **Bare `'publishable'` / `'secret'` match only the `default` key** in `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEYS` / `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEYS`. Use `secret:<name>` for a specific key or `secret:*` to accept any key in the set — see [Named key syntax](#named-key-syntax).

> **Supabase Edge Functions:** By default, the platform requires a valid JWT on every request same as `'user'`.
> If your function uses `'publishable'`, `'secret'` or `'none'`, disable the platform-level JWT check in `supabase/config.toml`:
>
> ```toml
> [functions.my-function]
> verify_jwt = false
> ```

## User mode

The default. Verifies the JWT using your project's JWKS (JSON Web Key Set).

```ts
import { withSupabase } from '@supabase/server'

export default {
  fetch: withSupabase({ auth: 'user' }, async (_req, ctx) => {
    // ctx.userClaims has the caller's identity
    console.log(ctx.userClaims!.id) // "d0f1a2b3-..."
    console.log(ctx.userClaims!.email) // "user@example.com"
    console.log(ctx.userClaims!.role) // "authenticated"

    // ctx.jwtClaims has the raw JWT payload
    console.log(ctx.jwtClaims!.sub) // same as userClaims.id
    console.log(ctx.jwtClaims!.exp) // token expiration (epoch seconds)

    // ctx.supabase is scoped to this user — RLS applies
    const { data } = await ctx.supabase.from('todos').select()
    return Response.json(data)
  }),
}
```

The caller must send:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

**`userClaims` vs `supabase.auth.getUser()`:** `userClaims` is extracted from the JWT and is available instantly — no network call. It includes `id`, `email`, `role`, `appMetadata`, and `userMetadata`. For the full Supabase `User` object (email confirmation status, providers, linked identities), call `ctx.supabase.auth.getUser()`, which makes a request to the auth server.

## Publishable mode

Validates that the `apikey` header contains a recognized publishable key. Uses timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks. See [`security.md`](security.md) for details.

```ts
import { withSupabase } from '@supabase/server'

export default {
  fetch: withSupabase({ auth: 'publishable' }, async (_req, ctx) => {
    // ctx.userClaims is null — no JWT involved
    // ctx.supabase is initialized as anonymous (RLS anon role)
    const { data } = await ctx.supabase.from('products').select()
    return Response.json(data)
  }),
}
```

The caller must send:

```
apikey: sb_publishable_abc123...
```

> **Bare `publishable` matches only the `default` key.** `auth: 'publishable'` validates **only** against the key named `default` in `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEYS`. It does **not** fall back to your named keys, so if every key in the set is named, bare `publishable` never matches. Use `publishable:<name>` to target a named key, or `publishable:*` to accept any key in the set — see [Named key syntax](#named-key-syntax).

## Secret mode

Validates that the `apikey` header contains a recognized secret key. Same timing-safe comparison as publishable mode. See [`security.md`](security.md) for details.

```ts
import { withSupabase } from '@supabase/server'

export default {
  fetch: withSupabase({ auth: 'secret' }, async (_req, ctx) => {
    // ctx.supabaseAdmin bypasses RLS — use for privileged operations
    const { data } = await ctx.supabaseAdmin.from('config').select()
    return Response.json(data)
  }),
}
```

The caller must send:

```
apikey: sb_secret_xyz789...
```

> **Bare `secret` matches only the `default` key.** `auth: 'secret'` validates **only** against the key named `default` in `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEYS`. It does **not** fall back to your named keys, so if every key in the set is named, bare `secret` never matches. Use `secret:<name>` to target a named key, or `secret:*` to accept any key in the set — see [Named key syntax](#named-key-syntax).

## None mode

No credentials required. Every request is accepted.

```ts
import { withSupabase } from '@supabase/server'

export default {
  fetch: withSupabase({ auth: 'none' }, async (_req, ctx) => {
    // ctx.authMode is 'none'
    // ctx.userClaims is null
    // ctx.supabase is anonymous (RLS anon role)
    return Response.json({ status: 'healthy' })
  }),
}
```

Use `none` for health checks, public APIs, or when you handle auth yourself inside the handler.

## Array syntax (multiple modes)

Accept multiple auth methods. Modes are tried in order — the first match wins. The array is for lists only: a single mode is written unwrapped (`auth: 'user'`), though `auth: ['user']` means the same thing.

```ts
import { withSupabase } from '@supabase/server'

export default {
  fetch: withSupabase({ auth: ['user', 'secret'] }, async (req, ctx) => {
    // ctx.authMode tells you which mode matched
    if (ctx.authMode === 'user') {
      // Called by an authenticated user
      const { data } = await ctx.supabase.from('reports').select()
      return Response.json(data)
    }

    // Called by another service with a secret key
    const { user_id } = await req.json()
    const { data } = await ctx.supabaseAdmin
      .from('reports')
      .select()
      .eq('user_id', user_id)
    return Response.json(data)
  }),
}
```

A request with a valid JWT matches `'user'`. A request with a valid secret key matches `'secret'`. A request with neither is rejected.

**Where `'none'` can go.** `'none'` matches every request, so it only earns its place as the **last** entry of a list — `auth: ['user', 'none']` is "a user if one is signed in, anonymous otherwise." Anything after it is unreachable, and a list of just `['none']` says nothing that a bare `auth: 'none'` doesn't. Both are type errors:

```ts
withSupabase({ auth: ['user', 'none'] }, handler) // ✅ optional user
withSupabase({ auth: 'none' }, handler) // ✅ open endpoint
withSupabase({ auth: ['none'] }, handler) // ❌ use the bare 'none'
withSupabase({ auth: ['none', 'user'] }, handler) // ❌ 'user' is unreachable
```

**Fallthrough vs rejection.** A mode is only "tried" when its credential is actually present. A request with no `Authorization` header moves on to the next mode. But if a JWT _is_ present and fails verification (malformed, expired, wrong signature, or missing a `sub` claim), the request is rejected immediately with `InvalidJwtError` (`INVALID_JWT`) — it will not silently fall through to `'publishable'`, `'secret'`, or `'none'`. This prevents a bad token from being downgraded to a less-privileged auth mode. API keys behave differently: `'publishable'` and `'secret'` fall through when no `apikey` header is sent and also when the key matches none of the mode's configured keys, because a key held under another name may still match a later mode. When no mode matches, the final error reports the mismatch.

## Named key syntax

When your project has multiple API keys (e.g., separate keys for web, mobile, and internal services), use the colon syntax to validate against a specific named key.

Keys are stored as a JSON object in `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEYS` or `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEYS`:

```json
{
  "default": "sb_publishable_123...",
  "web": "sb_publishable_abc...",
  "mobile": "sb_publishable_a1b2..."
}
```

### Target a specific key

```ts
// Only accept the "web" publishable key
withSupabase({ auth: 'publishable:web' }, handler)

// Only accept the "internal" secret key
withSupabase({ auth: 'secret:internal' }, handler)
```

### Wildcard — accept any key in the set

```ts
// Accept any publishable key
withSupabase({ auth: 'publishable:*' }, handler)

// Accept any secret key
withSupabase({ auth: 'secret:*' }, handler)
```

### Callers on Vercel

The Supabase Vercel integration sets `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` in Vercel to the most recently created secret key of the project. That value changes whenever a secret key is added or rotated, so it does not stay under any one name. Bare `secret` rejects it as soon as a key newer than `default` exists. For a function called from Vercel-hosted code, either accept any secret key or give Vercel a key of its own:

```ts
// Accept whichever secret key the integration synced
withSupabase({ auth: 'secret:*' }, handler)

// Or create a secret key named "vercel", set it in Vercel yourself as a
// variable the integration does not manage, and accept only that key
withSupabase({ auth: 'secret:vercel' }, handler)
```

### Which key matched?

When using named keys, `ctx.authMode` tells you the mode and `keyName` on the `AuthResult` (from core primitives) tells you which key matched. In the high-level `withSupabase` wrapper, the matched key is used internally for client creation.

### Combining named keys with other modes

```ts
withSupabase({ auth: ['user', 'publishable:web'] }, async (_req, ctx) => {
  // Accepts either a valid JWT or the "web" publishable key
  return Response.json({ authMode: ctx.authMode })
})
```

## Legacy keys and JWTs are not supported

This library only understands the new-format API keys (`sb_publishable_*` / `sb_secret_*`) and JWT signing keys (JWKS-based verification). Old-format `anon` / `service_role` JWT-style API keys and legacy HS256-signed user JWTs are rejected, not silently downgraded.

- On the API-key side, `classifyApiKey` recognizes old-format keys (`eyJ...`) only to produce a clearer `INVALID_API_KEY` error — it never accepts them.
- On the JWT side, `'user'` mode requires a `kid` in the token header; a legacy HS256 token signed with the project's shared JWT secret has no `kid` and is rejected before any JWKS lookup.

To use this library, migrate your project to the new API key format and to JWT signing keys — see the [API Keys](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/api-keys) and [JWT Signing Keys](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/signing-keys) guides.

## How auth flows through the system

1. `extractCredentials(request)` reads `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `apikey` from headers
2. Each mode in `auth` is tried in order against the extracted credentials
3. First match wins — returns an `AuthResult` with `authMode`, `token`, `userClaims`, `jwtClaims`, and `keyName`. A JWT that is present but fails verification terminates the chain with `InvalidJwtError` (`INVALID_JWT`). An `apikey` that matches none of a mode's keys falls through to the next mode, as does any absent credential.
4. The auth result is used to create scoped clients (`supabase` with the user's token, `supabaseAdmin` with the secret key — constructed on its first property access)
5. Everything is bundled into a `SupabaseContext` and passed to your handler
